/* ps1.h — the C ABI for ps1-core.
 *
 * CONTRACT RULES. These three are stated here because getting them wrong is
 * silent rather than loud.
 *
 * 1. The caller owns every buffer that crosses this boundary, with one
 *    exception: ps1_load_disc BORROWS the .bin data and does not copy it. Those
 *    bytes must outlive the handle, or the next ps1_load_disc call. The cue
 *    bytes are parsed immediately and are NOT borrowed.
 *
 * 2. Nothing traps across this boundary. Every failure is a negative code.
 *
 * 3. ps1_reset keeps the loaded BIOS and disc. It is the front-panel reset
 *    button, not a teardown. Running with no disc is valid and boots to the
 *    BIOS shell, so it is not an error condition.
